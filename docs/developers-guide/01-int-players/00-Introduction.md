### Web Version: Built Using p5.js and RNBO

The project is open-source and released under the GPL-3.0 license. It provides a powerful tool for those interested in experimenting with code, pushing the boundaries of music creation and listening.

#### **RNBO**

[RNBO](https://rnbo.cycling74.com) is a library and toolchain for building and exporting software that incorporates the sound of Max, a visual programming language for music and multimedia. RNBO enables users to create a wide range of music-related projects, including:

- Web experiences
- Hardware music devices
- Audio plugins
- New Max objects

RNBO offers an intuitive interface for patching and experimenting with code, making it accessible to musicians and programmers alike. This tool represents a versatile platform for music creation and experimentation.
