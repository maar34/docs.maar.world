### A Planet is a Vinyl + One Dimension

![Vinyl and Planet Player](/img/int-players/04-vinyl-sphere.png)

As a basic concept, playing an Interplanetary Player is playing with a sphere. Think of it as adding an extra dimension to a vinyl record, with the option to maintain or interchange sound parameters. Each card changes the settings in the X, Y, and Z axes and loop time. Each suit combined represents a track, and each deck is an album. You can add as many layers as your browser can handle, creating a rich and complex sound experience. With endless possibilities for listening and playing, the Interplanetary Players offer a new level of musical creativity and exploration.

### Web Player

Each card number is associated with a unique Interplanetary Player configuration that includes a selected set of transformation parameters. You can play the embedded player or switch to full-screen mode for an immersive experience. Additionally, you can play with multiple cards simultaneously, mixing their sounds to create unique sonic experiences every time.

If you are playing on an iPhone, it's essential to unmute your device first.


- To start and stop the sound, press the **PLAY/PAUSE ▶️ button**.
- The **XYZ Balance buttons** allow you to reset the parameters to their default positions, bypassing all transformations and restoring the original composition settings.
- Use the **XYZ knobs** to modify the sound parameters of the card by moving the slider to your desired position.
- The **Regenerative button** changes the modes of the Interplanetary Player.

### Supported Modes

The Interplanetary Player currently supports 7 modes:

1. **xJam**: Listen to music normally or play with the X, Y, Z knobs to transform music.
2. **Transit I**: Scale = 1 minute ~ 24 hours. X, Y, Z knobs change depending on transit date, impact parameter, and duration of the transit.
3. **Transit II**: Scale = 1 second ~ 24 hours.
4. **Transit III**: Scale = 50 milliseconds ~ 24 hours.
5. **Transit IV**: Scale = 15 milliseconds ~ 24 hours.
6. **Orbit V**: Scale = 1 minute ~ 24 hours. In the Kepler-47 system, each exoplanet's movement around its twin stars takes a specific amount of time, known as its orbital period.
7. **Orbit VI**: Scale = 1 second ~ 24 hours.
8. **Orbit VII**: Scale = 15 milliseconds ~ 24 hours.

### Mode Details

- **Transit Modes**: Four transit modes are based on the same measurements but scaled to different time intervals.
- **Orbit Modes**: Three orbit modes are based on the same measurements but scaled to different time intervals.

The **XYZ Balance buttons** function as info buttons, as users cannot override the exoplanet data control of the parameters. When pressed, a hint display appears as an overlay.

The innermost planet (Kepler-47 b) has an orbital period of ∼49.5 days and is the smallest of the known CBPs (∼3R⊕). The Uranus-size outer planet (Kepler-47 c) has a ∼303-day orbit, placing it well within the habitable zone."_
