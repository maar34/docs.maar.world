### Each ENT Card Includes an NFC Chip

[NFC section](/docs/user-guide/02-ent-cards/03-nfc.md) (Near Field Communication) is a technology designed to simplify and accelerate data exchange between devices. As an international transmission standard, NFC enables contactless data exchange over short distances of 1â€“4 cm.

Every NFC-enabled device, including smartphones and dedicated NFC readers, can read the information on an NFC chip. The information stored on the NFC chip can provide an enhanced experience associated with the card. With a dedicated NFC app like [NFC Tools](https://www.wakdev.com/en/apps.html), users can access metadata related to the NFT (non-fungible token) aspect of the card.

Place your [compatible device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NFC-enabled_mobile_devices) close to the card tag, and it will read the data on it. The NFC tag reader works best when the reading device is within 1.5 inches (4 centimeters) of the NFC tag.

### PC & MAC

Any NFC reader that supports the NTAG215 Chip can read the cards. Both PC and MAC users can find suitable hardware and software for this purpose in the market.
