### 100% Handmade Packaging in Uruguay

For the first collection, we partnered with local artisans to create unique packaging for our cards, suits, and decks. These skilled artisans were carefully selected for their dedication to their craft and their attention to detail, which are reflected in the quality of their work.

Each piece of packaging is crafted with care and precision, using locally sourced materials that not only support the local economy but also add a unique touch to our products. Maar World believes that our packaging, just like our cards, should be a work of art in and of itself. That is why we took the time to find the right artisans who share our vision. We take pride in knowing that our packaging not only looks beautiful but also has a positive impact on the community around us.
